🔧 Steps & Workflow
1⃣ Data Cleaning
•	Removed nulls in key columns: price, neighbourhood, beds.
•	Converted last_review to datetime.
•	Filtered outliers: Capped listings above $1,000 for better visualization.
2⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Room Type Distribution:
Entire homes/apartments dominate the listings.
•	Neighborhood Insights:
Manhattan has the highest average prices.
•	Price Distribution:
Most listings fall between $50 - $300.
•	Review Trends:
Listings with high review counts tend to have lower prices.
•	Availability Patterns:
Listings available year-round often offer better value.
3⃣ Visualizations
•	📦 Histograms & Boxplots – to analyze price distribution & outliers
•	📍 Scatter Plots – to visualize location & pricing
•	📈 Bar Charts – to show frequency by room type and neighborhood
•	🔥 Heatmaps – to identify feature correlations
